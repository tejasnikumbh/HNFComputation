 * Description : Program to compute the Hermite Normal Form for a given     *
 * matrix.Consists of the main program and the core function which is       *
 * compute_HNF.                                                             *
 * Concept : A HNF or Hermite Normal Form of a matrix A is a matrix         *
 * obtained by performing the following 3 column operations on A : -        *
 * 									    *	 
 *   1.Multiplication by -1                                                 *
 *   2.Exchanging two columns                                               *
 *   3.Add an integral multiple of a column to another.                     *
 * 								            * 
 * It is simply a reduced column echelon form of the given matrix. More     *
 * generally, we can represent the relationship between A and its           *
 * Hermite form using the following relation.                               *
 *    									    *							
 *      			AU = H					    *		
 *  									    *			
 * where U is the Unitary transform matrix applied to A to get H.           *
 * A full rank square matrix is said to be in Hermite Normal form if        *
 *   1. It is lower triangular                                              *
 *   2. It has positive diagonal entries                                    * 
 *   3. All entries to the left of a diagonal entry are strictly less than  *
 *      the diagonal entry.                                                 *
 * 									    * 
 * To give an example, given a matrix                                       *  
 *   A = [  9  -36   30                                                     *
 *        -36  192 -180                                                     *
 *         30 -180  180]                                                    *
 * if transformed to Hermite Matrix would give, : -                         *
 *   H = [  3  0  0                                                         *
 *          0 12  0                                                         *
 *         30  0 60]                                                        *
